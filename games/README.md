# 🎮 AgentEvolver Game Arena

**A unified arena for interaction, evaluation, and training of AI agents in social reasoning games.**


AgentEvolver Game Arena extends **AgentEvolver** into multi-agent social game environments. By focusing on board games with **multi-round, long-horizon interaction and clear reward rules**, and rich strategic spaces involving **hidden information, negotiation and deception**, it provides a controlled setting for developing **social and strategic capabilities** beyond task execution and tool use.



## ✨ What Can You Do?

### 1. Watch or Play AI Agents in Your Browser

A web-based interface allows you to:

- **Observer Mode** – Watch AI agents play in real time and inspect their reasoning, communication, and strategic decisions  
- **Participate Mode** – Join a game as a human player and play alongside or against AI agents to test their interactive capabilities  



We currently support two games, Avalon and Diplomacy, both of which are strategy games involving long-term reasoning.

You first need to select a game, then choose your agents, configure the settings, and finally start the arena.

### 3. Train AI Agents

AgentEvolver is designed to support **end-to-end training of AI agents in social board games**, enabling agents to learn from interaction, feedback, and long-horizon outcomes.

- Training agents directly within game environments  
- Support for reinforcement learning–based methods (e.g., GRPO)  

**Example:** Training curve for the assassin role in Avalon

<p align="center">
<img src="../docs/img/games/training_curve.jpg" alt="Training Curve" width="80%">
</p>

*The training curve above shows the performance of the **assassin** role in Avalon. The assassin uses **qwen2.5-14B** as the base model, while all other roles use **qwen-plus**. All roles use the default **ThinkingReActAgent**, which follows a think-then-speak pattern.*

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

We provide a minimal requirements for non-training usage:

    pip install -r games/requirements_game.txt

(Optional) Set environment variables for using LLM APIs:

    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=your_api_url
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key


---

### Launch the Web Interface

Start the server:

    python games/web/server.py

Then open your browser at:

    http://localhost:8000

From the web interface you can:

1. Select a game (Avalon or Diplomacy)  
2. Choose a mode (Observer or Participate)  
3. Configure players and models  
4. Start the game  

---

### Run a Model Evaluation

Run batch evaluations to systematically assess model performance across multiple games:

```bash
python games/evaluation/run_eval.py \
    --game avalon \
    --config games/games/avalon/configs/task_config.yaml \
    --num-games 10 \
    --max-workers 5
```

> To use local models, see introduction in `games/evaluation/run_eval.py`.

**Output:**
Results are displayed in formatted tables with:
- **Game-level statistics**: Aggregated metrics (e.g., win rates, game duration) with mean, max, and min values across all games
- **Role-level statistics**: Performance metrics broken down by role (e.g., Merlin, Servant, Assassin, Minion for Avalon) with mean, max, and min values
- **Summary**: Total number of games completed and overall statistics

🏟️ **For large-scale evaluations** with multiple models, fair model assignment, and Elo-based rankings, see the [Arena Leaderboard documentation](evaluation/leaderboard/README.md).

---

### Train an LLM Agent

**Prerequisites:** Before training, install the required packages using `install.sh` from the project root, and additionally install game-specific dependencies:
```bash
bash install.sh
pip install -r games/requirements_game.txt
```

Training consists of two main steps:

#### Step 1: Generate Training Tasks

Generate training task Parquet files from game-specific training configurations:

```bash
# Generate training tasks for Avalon
python games/generate_train_parquet.py \
    --game avalon \
    --config games/games/avalon/configs/train_config.yaml \
    --output ./train_avalon_tasks.parquet \
    --num_tasks 10
```

The config specifies task details and which roles/models are trainable (set `trainable: true`).


#### Step 2: Start Training

**Option 1: One-click script (Recommended)**

Use the provided training script for quick start:

```bash
# Make sure to update the script with your paths and configuration
bash examples/game/avalon/run_train.sh
```

**Option 2: Python command**

Run the training script directly with Python:

```bash
python -m agentevolver.main_ppo \
    --config-path="examples/game/avalon" \
    --config-name='config' \
    data.train_files="./train_avalon_tasks.parquet" \
    data.val_files="./train_avalon_tasks.parquet" \
    # ... other training parameters
```

> 💡 **Tip**: The script `examples/game/avalon/run_train.sh` contains a complete training configuration. You can modify it to customize training parameters, model paths, and other settings.



## ⚙️ Configuration

Games and evaluations are controlled via **YAML configuration files**. The configuration uses a unified role-based structure where `model` and `agent` configurations are separated but grouped under each role.

### Configuration Structure

- **Game settings** (`game`) – Game-specific parameters (e.g., `num_players`, `language`)
- **Default role** (`default_role`) – Default settings for all roles, containing:
  - `trainable`, `act_by_user` – Role-level flags
  - `model` – Model configuration (API settings, model name, temperature, etc.)
  - `agent` – Agent configuration (type, memory, formatter, toolkit, etc.)
- **Role-specific settings** (`roles`) – Override `default_role` for specific roles. Each role can have:
  - `trainable`, `act_by_user` – Override role-level flags
  - `model` – Override or extend model configuration
  - `agent` – Override or extend agent configuration

**Configuration Priority:** Role-specific settings in `roles` section override `default_role` settings. Nested dictionaries (like `model` and `agent`) are merged recursively, so you only need to specify the fields you want to change.

### Example

    game:
      name: avalon
      num_players: 5
      language: en
    
    default_role:
      trainable: false
      act_by_user: false
      model:
        model_name: qwen-plus
        temperature: 0.7
        max_tokens: 2048
      agent:
        type: ThinkingReActAgent
        kwargs:
          sys_prompt: ""
          memory:
            type: InMemoryMemory
            kwargs: {}
    
    roles:
      assassin:
        model:
          model_name: custom-model  # Only overrides model_name, other model settings inherited
        # agent not specified, uses default_role.agent  




## 🧠 Build Your Own Agents

The AgentEvolver Game Arena is designed to be extensible and customizable. You can:

- **Develop custom agents** - Implement your own agent logic, strategies, and reasoning capabilities. Reference `games/agents/thinking_react_agent.py` and configure via `roles.<role_name>.agent.type` in YAML.
- **Design memory systems** - Build memory architectures that help agents remember game history, player behaviors, and strategic patterns. Create formatters for message formatting and token management. Configure via `roles.<role_name>.agent.kwargs.memory` and `roles.<role_name>.agent.kwargs.formatter` in YAML.
- **Train models** - Use the provided training pipeline to fine-tune models for specific roles, strategies, or game scenarios.

**Configuration Structure:** Each role configuration has separate `model` and `agent` sub-sections, making it easy to customize both independently. The `default_role` section provides defaults for all roles, which can be overridden per-role in the `roles` section.

See `games/games/avalon/configs/default_config.yaml` and `games/games/diplomacy/configs/default_config.yaml` for detailed configuration examples.

Now, try anything you want. Build your own agents, memories, or models. And one day, let's see them meet — and compete — in the arena.
