  <strong>AgentEvolver: An Efficient Self-Evolving Agent System</strong><br>
</p> -->

**AgentEvolver** is an end-to-end, self-evolving training framework that unifies self-questioning, self-navigating, and self-attributing into a cohesive system. It empowers agents to autonomously
improve their capabilities, aiming for efficient, cost-effective, and continuous capability evolution.

## ✨ Why AgentEvolver



🧠 AgentEvolver provides three **Self-Evolving Mechanisms** from Environment to Policy:

- **Automatic Task Generation (Self-Questioning)** – Explore the environment and autonomously create diverse tasks, eliminating costly manual dataset construction.
- **Experience-guided Exploration (Self-Navigating)** – Summarize and reuse cross-task experience, guiding higher-quality rollouts and improving exploration efficiency.
- **Attribution-based Credit Assignment (Self-Attributing)** – Process long trajectories to uncover the causal contribution of intermediate steps, enabling fine-grained and efficient policy optimization.

## 🔧 Architecture Design
AgentEvolver adopts a service-oriented dataflow architecture, seamlessly integrating environment sandboxes, LLMs, and experience management into modular services.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/img/system.png" alt="system framework" width="80%">
</p>


- **Environment Compatibility** – Standardized interfaces for seamless integration with a wide range of external environments and tool APIs.
- **Flexible Context Manager** – Built-in utilities for managing multi-turn contexts and complex interaction logic, supporting diverse deployment scenarios.
- **Modular & Extensible Architecture** – Decoupled components allow easy customization, secondary development, and future algorithm upgrades.


## 🌟 Benchmark Performance

Performance comparison on the AppWorld and BFCL-v3 benchmarks. AgentEvolver achieves superior results while using substantially fewer parameters than larger baseline models.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Step 1. Basic Dependency Installation

Make sure you have **conda** and **cuda toolkit** installed.

Then, set up the training environment by running the script

```bash
bash install.sh
```


### Step 2. Setup Env-Service (Appworld as example)
The script below sets up an environment for appworld.

```bash
cd env_service/environments/appworld && bash setup.sh
```

### Step 3. Setup ReMe (Optional)
Set up the ReMe for experience management by running the script:
```bash
bash external/reme/install_reme.sh
```
For more detailed installation, please refer to [ReMe](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe).

### Step 4. Begin Training! 🚀 🚀
Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and modify the parameters, including your **API key**, **conda path**.

Using AgentEvolver launcher to start environment, log dashboard and training process altogether.

```bash
conda activate agentevolver

# option 1: minimal example without ReMe (using built-in datasets within environments)
python launcher.py --conf examples/basic.yaml --with-appworld

# option 2: full example with ReMe (questioning + navigating + attributing)
python launcher.py --conf examples/overall.yaml --with-appworld --with-reme
```

Alternatively, you can use bash scripts for manual execution: `bash examples/run_basic.sh` or `bash examples/run_overall.sh`. See [Advanced Usage](#-advanced-usage) for more details.



## 🎮 AgentEvolver Game Arena

**[AgentEvolver Game Arena](games/README.md)** extends **AgentEvolver** into **multi-agent social game environments**, providing a unified arena for **interaction, evaluation, and training** of AI agents in long-horizon social reasoning tasks.

Key capabilities include:
- **Web-based interaction** – Observe AI agents' reasoning and communication in real time, or participate as a human player.
- **Scalable evaluation** – Run large-scale self-play or mixed-model tournaments with configurable settings and leaderboards.
- **End-to-end training support** – Train LLM agents directly within social game environments using reinforcement learning–based methods (e.g., GRPO).
